# NGO_Website_Project

This repository contains the frontend code for a responsive NGO website built during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. <br>
I employed HTML, CSS to create this user-friendly and visually appealing interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.  <br>
The website aims to raise awareness about the NGO's causes, engage with the community, and mobilize support for the NGO's initiatives.
