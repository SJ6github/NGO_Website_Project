# NGO_Website_Project

This repository contains the frontend code for a responsive NGO website built during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies.
I employed HTML, CSS to create this user-friendly and visually appealing interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
The website aims to raise awareness about the NGO's causes, engage with the community, and mobilize support for the NGO's initiatives.
